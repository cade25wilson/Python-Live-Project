# Python-Live-Project
 
<h1>Django Project Information</h1>
<p>During the past two weeks I have been developing a hobby manager web application with my fellow peers in the Tech Academy. This application required a combination of computer languages in order to produce the full product. These languages include HTML, CSS, Python, and Django. Throughout this project I have learned the important factors that go into creating a website based off of multiple templates and the inheritance between them. In order to get each part of the application to work together, a combination of both Python and Django were used on the back end so that each file was linked properly. These links include button functions, url mapping, and the ability to communicate with a database. The usage of the database was important for saving useful data related to the given hobby application.

With multiple languages working together, bugs and errors were bound to occur. Thankfully, I was able to overcome those unforseen obstacles and turn them into learning opportunities which in hand is very valuable. Iam proud of what I have created, and Iam fortunate for the opportunity to work with other peers and collaborate all I have been learning.</p>
